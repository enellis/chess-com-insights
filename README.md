## üöÄ How it works

This extension shows statistics for chess.com games. 
Use the icon in the top right corner to adjust the settings.

- First three numbers are the wins/loses/draws of the player
- Percentage in brackets is the average accuracy of the player
    - Accuracy is only available on games which were reviewed
