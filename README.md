## 🚀 How it works

This extension works only on chrome based browsers and is only for chess.com at the moment. It shows stats for both players. 

- First three numbers are the wins/loses/draws of the player 
- Percentage in brackets is the average accuracy of the player
  - Accuracy is only available on games which were reveiwed
- All stats are for the last 20 games, but will be customizable in the future
